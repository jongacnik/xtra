	<h2 class="century">Submission Guidelines</h2>
	<p>X-TRA is a journal of record. Writers should imagine their articles in the long term and consider aspects of artistic production they feel are significant, eschewing newsy reports or judgments for more extended and reasoned inquiry. X-TRA’s editorial board reserves the right to refuse articles more appropriate for other settings.

	<br><br>X-TRA accepts both commissions and unsolicited manuscripts. With unsolicited manuscripts, include writing samples. All writers are encouraged to discuss article ideas with the editors before submitting finished articles. Except under special circumstances, we do not reprint previously published pieces.

	<br><br>Articles must be formatted in Microsoft Word and submitted as an email attachment to <br><a href="editors@x-traonline.org">editors@x-traonline.org</a> 
	</p>

	<h2 class="century">Reviews</h2>
	<p>Reviews are generally 500–4000 words. X-TRA is committed to publishing reviews that critically and thoroughly engage the work of art as it is experienced in the public sphere, believing that the encounter between the work of art and an informed, impartial viewer is the core experience that manifests our collective cultural investment in and hope for visual arts today. Reviews should promote critical dialogue, rather than report on or evaluate works of art. They may cover individual or group exhibitions, installations, screenings and performances; or they may examine one or more publications. We prefer that references be placed within the text, but endnotes are acceptable.</p>

<div class="subs-row times">
	<h2 class="century">Features</h2>
	<p>Ranging from 2,000–10,000 words, feature articles may be scholarly research; they may be biographies of or interviews with artists or critics; they may use an event, exhibition, book, video, etc. as a jumping-off point for a discussion of larger economic, political and cultural issues. Use of endnotes is expected but not required. </p>
</div>
<div class="subs-row times">
	<h2 class="century">Columns</h2>
	<p>Columns (generally from 500–3000 words) may be written in a more “subjective” voice and may be on or about virtually any subject in the domain of visual art and cultural criticism. Endnotes are permitted. </p>
